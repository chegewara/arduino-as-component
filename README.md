# Arduino as component example

This is example to show how to update CMakeLists.txt in components to build with arduino esp32s2 branch and esp-idf master (v4.x).
With this template it wont be too hard to add new components, because this file can be used as template.

It is added in submodule in case i would like to add more examples
